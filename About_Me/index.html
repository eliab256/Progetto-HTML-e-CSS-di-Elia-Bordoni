              <p>
                Hi, my name is Elia Bordoni, I'm 27 years old, and I live in a town near Milan. My educational 
                journey started in high school where I attended the Gallini Agricultural Technical Institute in Voghera. 
                After finishing school, I realized that it wasn't what I wanted to do. At that time, my greatest passion 
                was music, so I decided to pursue this path and try to make it a career. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I attended various schools and online courses (all self-funded) while working as an electrician in my 
                father's company. For about seven years, I juggled my job as an electrician and my passion for music. 
                This passion allowed and, in a sense, forced me to develop various soft skills, opening up the world of 
                personal growth and inner development, of which I am a great enthusiast. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Among the various aspects of life that I wanted to develop was the 
                economic side. This led me to study personal finance and investments, as well as to foster a strong interest 
                in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. After years, I realized that music and creativity were not for 
                me, and I abandoned this life project. After an initial period of coping with the blow, I settled down and, 
                deciding what to do with my future. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I decided to combine my passion for cryptocurrencies with my latent 
                interest in computer science. This is why I decided to start studying the Start2Impact master program, 
                confident that it will help me create a career that excites me and brings great satisfaction after the 
                disappointment of abandoning my music project.
